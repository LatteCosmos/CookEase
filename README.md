### About CookEase

We are a cooking-first company, powered by smart AI, with a mission to make healthy eating easy for everyone. Life is busy — work, family, and countless other priorities often leave little time for cooking. That’s why many people struggle with diet and long-term health.

CookEase solves this with an **AI-driven meal planning system**. Tell us your tastes and dietary needs, and our AI creates a personalized weekly meal plan. Then, together with our trusted cooking partners, we prepare and deliver your meals right to your doorstep in select cities.

Choose a flexible monthly subscription — 1 or 2 meals per day, every single day — designed to keep you healthy and stress-free.
